## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-25

### Added
- **New notification type: API Error 401** ðŸ”´
  - Detects authentication errors when OAuth token expires
  - Shows "ðŸ”´ API Error: 401" with message "Please run /login"
  - Triggered when both "API Error: 401" and "Please run /login" appear in assistant messages
  - Priority detection (checks before tool-based detection)
  - Added comprehensive tests for API error detection

### Improved
- **Binary size optimization** - 30% smaller release binaries
  - Production builds now use `-ldflags="-s -w" -trimpath` flags
  - Binary size reduced from ~10 MB to ~7 MB per platform
  - Faster download times for users (5 seconds instead of 8 seconds)
  - Better privacy (no developer paths in binaries)
  - Deterministic builds across different machines
  - Development builds unchanged (still include debug symbols)

### Changed
- Updated notification count from 5 to 6 types in README
- All tests passing with new features

## [1.0.3] - 2025-10-24

### Fixed
- Critical bug in duration calculation ("Took" time in notifications)
  - User text messages were not being detected in transcript parsing
  - `GetLastUserTimestamp` now correctly parses string content format
  - Duration now shows accurate time (e.g., "Took 5m" instead of "Took 2h 30m")
  - Tool counting now accurate (prevents showing inflated counts like "Edited 32 files")
- Added custom JSON marshaling/unmarshaling for `MessageContent` to handle both string and array content formats

### Technical Details
- Fixed `pkg/jsonl/jsonl.go`: Added `ContentString` field and custom `UnmarshalJSON`/`MarshalJSON` methods
- User messages with `"content": "text"` format now properly parsed (previously only array format worked)
- All existing tests pass + added new tests for string content parsing
