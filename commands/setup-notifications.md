# Setup Notifications Plugin

You are helping the user configure the claude-notifications plugin interactively. Follow these steps carefully:

## Step 1: Detect System Sounds

First, detect the operating system and find available system sounds:

**For macOS:**
- List sounds in `/System/Library/Sounds/`
- Common sounds: Glass.aiff, Ping.aiff, Pop.aiff, Purr.aiff, Funk.aiff, Hero.aiff, Sosumi.aiff, Basso.aiff, Blow.aiff, Frog.aiff, Submarine.aiff, Bottle.aiff, Morse.aiff, Tink.aiff

**For Linux:**
- Check `/usr/share/sounds/` and subdirectories
- Look for .ogg, .wav files

## Step 2: Present Available Sounds

Show the user a formatted list of all available sounds with descriptions. For example:

**Available System Sounds:**
- **Glass** - Crisp, clean chime
- **Ping** - Subtle ping sound
- **Hero** - Triumphant fanfare
- **Funk** - Distinctive funk sound
- **Pop** - Quick pop sound
- **Purr** - Gentle purr
- **Basso** - Deep bass sound
- **Sosumi** - Pleasant notification
- **Tink** - Light metallic sound
- **Frog** - Unique ribbit sound
- **Submarine** - Sonar-like ping
- (etc.)

Tell the user: "You can ask me to play any sound before making your choice. For example, say 'play Glass' or '–ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª—É—à–∞—Ç—å Hero'. When you're ready, I'll ask you to select sounds for each notification type."

## Step 3: Interactive Sound Selection

For EACH notification type (Task Complete, Review Complete, Question, Plan Ready):

1. **Announce the notification type** you're configuring
2. **Remind the user** they can request to play any sound (e.g., "play Funk", "–ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª—É—à–∞—Ç—å Ping")
3. **Wait for user to explore sounds** - If user requests to play a sound:
   - Play it using bash: `afplay /System/Library/Sounds/[SoundName].aiff` (macOS) or `paplay /usr/share/sounds/[file]` (Linux)
   - Ask if they want to hear more sounds or are ready to choose
4. **When user is ready**, use AskUserQuestion to gather their final choice

## Step 4: Ask Confirmation Questions

After the user has explored sounds for each notification type, use AskUserQuestion to confirm their selections. Structure the questions as follows:

**For each notification type (Task Complete, Review Complete, Question, Plan Ready):**
- **question**: "Which sound would you like for '[Type]' notifications?"
- **header**: "[Type]"
- **multiSelect**: false
- **options**: List all available system sounds with brief descriptions

**Example options format:**
- Glass - "Crisp, clean chime"
- Ping - "Subtle ping sound"
- Hero - "Triumphant fanfare"
- Funk - "Distinctive funk sound"
- Pop - "Quick pop sound"
- Purr - "Gentle purr"
- Basso - "Deep bass sound"
- Sosumi - "Pleasant notification"
- (include all detected sounds)

### Webhook Configuration
**question**: "Do you want to enable webhook notifications?"
**header**: "Webhook"
**multiSelect**: false
**options**:
- "No" - "Desktop notifications only"
- "Yes, JSON format" - "Send structured JSON to webhook"
- "Yes, text format" - "Send plain text to webhook"

**If webhook is enabled**, inform the user:
"Please edit `config/config.json` manually to add your webhook URL and any custom headers."

## Step 5: Create Configuration File

Based on the user's answers, create the `config/config.json` file. Use the following template:

```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "desktop": {
      "enabled": true,
      "sound": true
    },
    "webhook": {
      "enabled": <true/false based on answer>,
      "url": "",
      "format": "<json/text based on answer>",
      "headers": {}
    }
  },
  "statuses": {
    "task_complete": {
      "title": "‚úÖ Task Completed",
      "sound": "/System/Library/Sounds/<user's choice>",
      "keywords": ["completed", "done", "finished", "—É—Å–ø–µ—à–Ω–æ", "–∑–∞–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω"]
    },
    "review_complete": {
      "title": "üîç Review Completed",
      "sound": "/System/Library/Sounds/<user's choice>",
      "keywords": ["review", "—Ä–µ–≤—å—é", "analyzed", "–ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ—Ä–∫–∞", "analysis"]
    },
    "question": {
      "title": "‚ùì Question",
      "sound": "/System/Library/Sounds/<user's choice>",
      "keywords": ["question", "–≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å", "clarify"]
    },
    "plan_ready": {
      "title": "üìã Plan Ready",
      "sound": "/System/Library/Sounds/<user's choice>",
      "keywords": ["plan", "–ø–ª–∞–Ω", "strategy"]
    }
  }
}
```

**IMPORTANT**:
- Get the plugin directory path using: `cd "$(dirname "$(readlink -f "$0" || echo "$0")")"`
- Write the config to `config/config.json` relative to the plugin root directory
- For Linux, adjust sound paths to use `/usr/share/sounds/` instead

## Step 6: Confirm Success

After creating the config file:
1. Show the user the generated configuration
2. Confirm setup is complete
3. Suggest they can re-run `/setup-notifications` anytime to reconfigure
4. If webhook was enabled, remind them to edit the URL in `config/config.json`

## Step 7: Test Notification

Offer to test the notification by playing the selected "task_complete" sound to confirm it works.
