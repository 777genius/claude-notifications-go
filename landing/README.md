# Notification landing

Static Nuxt 3 / Vue landing adapted from Universal Agent Plugins at commit afc94dfeb649d3e44be4c04cd12a8347ab982e1d. `components/PageBackground.vue` is copied from that project; the CSS palette, glow and panel treatment are adapted. Upstream Apache-2.0 license and notice are retained in public/. Registry/catalog/server/i18n/SDK features and unused dependencies were removed.

Node 22.12+; exact dependencies and package-lock.json. Stable versions verified against npm registry on 2026-09-09. Nuxt stays on the source project's supported major 3 rather than mixing a major migration into the adaptation.

```sh
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run generate
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:browser
npm run preview
```

Production preview is http://127.0.0.1:4173/claude-notifications-go/. Bowser provides OS detection; mobile/unknown requires explicit target selection. It never decides runtime binary architecture. Install/update command generation lives in data/install.ts; configure uses documented product-specific instructions, not bootstrap flags.

The site does not install software or grant trust. Browser tests validate generated commands and navigation only. Notification previews are illustrations. The visible Codex release prerequisite is intentionally explicit until a capable release is published; update this copy when release status changes.

GitHub Actions tests static production output, combines it with existing gh-pages contents and publishes through deploy-pages. Existing paths remain in the artifact; gh-pages baseline is preserved. Old Pages baseline: c1f24598233b0d55543c12a3d276175be26d3593. Rollback: switch Pages source back to the preserved gh-pages branch through repository Pages settings, or redeploy a previously qualified Pages artifact. Deployments on main are serialized.
